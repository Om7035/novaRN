# 🚀 NovaRN Quick Start Guide

## ✅ Everything is Working! Here's How to Use It

### 🧪 Test the CLI (Run This Now)
```bash
# Navigate to the template directory
cd f:\NOVA\NovaRNTemplate

# Test the CLI locally
npm run test-cli

# This will create a test-app, verify it works, then clean up
```

### 🚀 Deploy to Production
```bash
# From f:\NOVA\NovaRNTemplate directory
npm run deploy

# This will:
# 1. Test everything locally
# 2. Commit changes to Git
# 3. Push to GitHub (https://github.com/Om7035/novaRN)
# 4. Publish CLI to npm (create-nova-rn)
```

### 🌍 Users Can Then Run
```bash
# Anyone in the world can now run:
npx create-nova-rn MyApp
cd MyApp
npm install
npx expo start
```
