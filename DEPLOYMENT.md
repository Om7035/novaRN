## 📊 Repository Structure (Perfect!)

```
NovaRNTemplate/                 # 🏠 Main repo (template)
├── cli/                       # 📦 CLI tool (create-nova-rn)
│   ├── package.json          # CLI npm package
│   ├── index.js              # CLI logic
│   └── README.md             # CLI docs
├── src/                      # 🎯 Template source
├── app/                      # 📱 Expo Router structure  
├── scripts/
│   └── deploy.js             # 🚀 Automated deployment
├── SETUP.md                  # 📋 Complete setup guide
├── DEPLOYMENT.md             # 🚀 This file
└── package.json              # Template package
```

**Why this structure is perfect:**
- ✅ Single repo for template + CLI (easier maintenance)
- ✅ CLI downloads template from GitHub (always fresh)
- ✅ Users get clean projects (no CLI folder)
- ✅ You can update both template and CLI together
